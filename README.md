# General Information about the Project
# 1. Title: 
Reducing your carbon foodprint with local fruits and veggies!
# 2. Problem statement:  
Approximately 80 % of the Carbon Emissions of food are caused by transportation. That means a lot of Carbon Emissions could be reduced by buying local fruits and vegetables. However, a lot of people are not aware of the fact, that buying locally would make a big difference when it comes to fruits and vegetables. Therefore, we want to provide an application, in which the Users can track their carbon foodprint and see how much emissions are caused by the production of the food and how much emissions are caused by the transportation of the food. We also want to provide visualizations, that makes it even clearer that buying locally can make a big difference.
# 3. Solution Pitch:
With our carbon foodprint calculator, users can add the fruits and vegetables they have bought to a virtual shopping list. By specifying the weight of the items, where the items were purchased, and what the fruit’s / vegetable’s origin is, the application can determine the carbon emissions that arise from the production and the transportation of the items and provide the information in a table for the user. Furthermore, the application provides a pie chart, that visualizes the impact that buying fruits/vegetables locally can have on reducing the carbon foodprint.
# 4. Impact on Sustainability 
As man-made climate change continues and poses a major problem for the future of the earth, sustainability and the awareness of everyone's responsibility to protect the environment is an important issue these days. There is already scientific consensus that carbon emissions play a major role in driving climate change forward. For this reason, we have focused our project on reducing carbon emissions by motivating the users to buy local fruit and vegetables. Due to the fact, that our application provides a calculation of the carbon emissions of the desired items, a more conscious buying behavior by the user can be achieved. The visualizations can also increase the awareness of the user concerning the fact that buying locally can save a large part of the carbon emissions. 
# 5. Future possible functionalities
Several extensions of the application would be possible in the future. In the beginning, the plan of the project was to provide carbon emission-saving alternatives to the items, based on similar nutrients. Unfortunately, this functionality could not be implemented due to the time limit, but it is highly interesting for future extensions of the application. An annual calendar with information on which foods are locally available in the respective countries at certain times would also be conceivable for the future. Additionally, user accounts are something that we experimented around with. Unfortunately, we were not able to implement these without compromising other features of the program. Still the possibility of different accounts also enables future implementations. Such could be visualizations that compare one user's emissions to the rest, which could be displayed via heatmaps or graphs.

# How to use the calculator:
1. Install all necessary modules (tkinter, pandas, numpy...)

2. Run the code

3. Select the item bought, its weights, origin, your location and click "add to shopping list". The item should appear underneath the buttons. Repeat this as often as desired

4. Once you are done, click "ready". This will open another window where a table will apear, which shows the carbon emissions caused by your shopping list.
